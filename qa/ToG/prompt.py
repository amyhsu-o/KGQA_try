A: 
1. {{(Brahui Language | main country | Pakistan) (Score: 0.5)}}: This triple remains the most relevant since the focus of the question is on identifying the country where Brahui was the main spoken language in 1980, directly tied to the question.
2. {{(Brahui Language | countries spoken in | Pakistan) (Score: 0.3)}}: This triple confirms and reinforces that Brahui is spoken in Pakistan, supporting the primary answer and narrowing the search.
3. {{(Brahui Language | region | Balochistan) (Score: 0.2)}}: I would prioritize this triple over "parent language" because it adds geographical context that is directly relevant to identifying Pakistan. Understanding that Balochistan is a key region where Brahui is spoken enhances the overall relevance.
